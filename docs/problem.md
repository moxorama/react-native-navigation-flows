# The Problem

In complex applications, navigation requirements often go beyond simple screen-to-screen transitions. Here are some common challenges this concept addresses:

## Context-Dependent Screen Behavior
- The same screen can be part of different user flows depending on the context
- For example, a "Profile" screen might behave differently when accessed from:
  - Main navigation
  - Settings flow
  - Onboarding flow
  - Payment verification flow

## Nested User Flows
- Sometimes, one user flow needs to be embedded within another flow
- Common examples include:
  - KYC verification as part of a payment flow
  - Address verification within a checkout process
  - Document upload as part of account setup
